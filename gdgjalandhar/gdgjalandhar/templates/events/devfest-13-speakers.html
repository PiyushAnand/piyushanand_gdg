                                    <p>I’m Gilmerio.I was born in Ahmadi, Kuwait on St. Patrick’s Day, though it’s not really celebrated there ever. L I have gradereports from at least 4 different schools and 3 different colleges throughout my educational journey.Made loads of acquaintances and a few friends across countries (couple of whom I’m still in touch with).I have a BSC in Software Engineering from Champlain College, Burlington Vermont. After which I trained at SAP forthe ABAP module.I’m in love with Music and I love playing my guitar. I enjoy learning new “things” (By things I actually mean things…since they’re so varied, they span from cooking, to fashion designing, to graphic art, to mobile operating systems,to automobile engineering, to literature, to computer assembly… the list goes on).I believe that nothing is impossible and “Aut Viam Inveniam, Aut Faciam” is a quote Hannibal said just for me. Ittranslates loosely to “I will either find a way, or make one” (Here Hannibal refers to the military commander ofancient Carthage and not the TV show/Movie/Book in case you were wondering!) I believe in it so much, I have ittattooed across my chest JI’ve been with UGAM since December 2010 where I started off as a junior survey programmer. I was with EAngelus solutions before that, where I worked as a Network Administrator. Before that I was with M-Phasis whereI supported SUN Microsystems SWAN network and prior to that I was working a part time job at a local cyber-café.I did the cyber café thing for fun so I could actually game for free.I’m a hardcore gamer and I practically live in cyberspace. At the moment I’m playing this game called “Ingress” andif any of you guys are interested to join, I’d love to hook you up; though you need an android device. Its part of anew concept called “Augmented Reality”.Last but not the least I’m a biker and my 1984 Royal Enfield Classic 350 is the love of my life. I also love my whiskeyon the rocks and my food grilled to perfection.</p>

                                    <p>Abhik Chatterjee is a tech-rabid gypsy who harbours a fetish for internet technology and football. A proverbial "Engineer" from the University of Life (Read Mumbai), Abhik decided not to pay heed to family/friends and dived in to the Entrepreneurial shark-pool and came with two start-ups: He is currently thus the Founder and CEO of DEED-Developing Empowered Education, trying the add the zing and zest to the world of learning; and the Founder and Managing Director of FOOTERS, an organization attempting to be the voice of football in India. Having worked with Reliance, Zee Entertainment and Hungama Digital, Abhik is now on a laze-innovate-craze mission as he tries to live life.. In shorts.. Sometimes in front of the camera by hosting his Football Talk Show and by engulfing himself in technology all the time.
